Turn on your browser's hardware acceleration for things to work smoothly.

### A simple Javascript web game created using KaboomJS.
Patuti, the alien, has to dodge all the bullets and must not get hit.
#### This project was created using KaboomJS, NodeJS, and ExpressJS.

## KaboomJS

I will not be updating this game anymore. </br>
So if the game doesn't work anymore, then it's probably because KaboomJS has new updates.

## Installation

Requires NodeJS <br>

`npm install` <br>
`npm run start` <br>
